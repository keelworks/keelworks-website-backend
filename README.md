### Quick Start Workflow for developers

<br>

#### 1. Ensure You Are on the "develop" Branch:

```bash

git checkout develop

```

<br>

#### 2. Pull the Latest Changes from the Remote develop Branch:

```bash

git pull origin develop

```

<br>

#### 3. Create and Switch to a New Feature Branch:

```bash

git checkout -b feature/<your feature-name>

```

<br>

#### 4. Push the Feature Branch to the Remote Repository:

```bash

git push -u origin feature/<feature-name>

```
